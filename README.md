# Arduino-DC-Volt-Meter
This project is about the simple hack of voltmeter by Arduino. The main reason behind making this is from my personal experience, when I was performing one experiment in the lab, I could not find a voltmeter so I made this hack to fulfill my requirement and also I think it will help others too.

Good project for beginners which uses basic concepts, yet a power full tool.

While running the code, you can find the output on the serial monitor.
